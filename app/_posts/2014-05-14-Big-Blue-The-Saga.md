Nick's a good friend from way back that i happen to bump into after not seeing for many years.I find he's running his own sound system - PA if you will - company and would i mind helping out.So while i was still with a few basic flex projects on my bench after doing richard's site i knocked up a quick flash site.Thankyou very much.And much was good and quite impressive at the time, garnered a lot of good feedback and notice in an otherwise pallid design marketplace.

Over time the cracks started to show.Ok more like a seismic rift.

Mobile sites were being used properly ( hoho anyone remember WAP?)

And it was then i realised flash wasn't the global approach to website design any more.A mobile first approach is now required, so the first step was to recreate teh site in HTML5/CSS and JS.A few jquery plugs sorted out most of the dynamic display mechanisms from flash.

But it's never the end sometimes.Great says Nick, small bijou problemette, love ya work and all that, can you smush it for iphones.Most of my clients etc.

So here we are, slowly adapting the site in a responsive mechanism, and taking the opportunity to reinvent the site as a single page application (SPA) using Angular as the framework.Yes overkill for such a simple site but it gives plenty for me to hang my hat on in time.
