having used most of the yeoman builds i know from experience the build cycle of grunt can get quite time consuming, so having read of the advantages of gulp i finally installed this in a fresh copy of laravel.From the off gulp's turnaround time is considerably faster, and as has been noted its syntax makes for a easier scan and faster writing

sass,watch,imagemin and uglify - all the usual build tools - are easily implimented.Looking forward to expanding on it over time(see if i cant get it as slow as grunt again hah)
